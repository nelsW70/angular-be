                    For more than 25 years, the photographer Bernhard Edmaier, 
                    who initially studied geology, has been very deeply dedicated 
                    to photographing the surface of our planet – the forces of Nature 
                    which form the Earth.  His seemingly abstract aerial images, in 
                    which high quality photography and science unite, have caused 
                    international sensation and have been received with great excitement 
                    by international audiences.

                    Bernhard Edmaier’s magnificent aerial images won him a renowned 
                    Kodak Photo Book Prize in 1998. In 2001 he received the Hasselblad 
                    Master Award. His art photography is firmly rooted in geology. 
                    It is his aim to present the manifold colours, forms and structures 
                    which the Earth has created without man’s interference. In order to 
                    achieve this aim, Bernhard Edmaier uses aerial photography as his medium.

                    Driven by his perennial interest in natural phenomena, Bernhard Edmaier 
                    travels extensively to deserted and still untouched corners of the globe 
                    to gather material for his books and other photographic projects.
